         		The Exposed Mass Timber Calculator is designed to help users determine if their encapsulated mass timber construction (EMTC) compartment designs are code-compliant with the 2025 edition of the National Building Code of Canada (NBC). 
         	</p>
         	<p>
         		This tool evaluates the necessary dimensions of mass timber elements and the permissible percentages of exposed mass timber elements, including beams, columns, walls, and ceilings within suites and fire compartments.

         	</h6>
         	<p>
         		To use the tool, users will need to input the following information regarding their compartment design:
         	</p>
         	<ul>
         		<li>
         			Compartment size and perimeter wall layout
         		</li>
         		<li>
         			Compartment designation: Suite or Fire compartment
         		</li>
         		<li>
         			Interior compartment design, including all partitions and openings
         		</li>
         		<li>
         			Location and size of all mass timber elements<br/>
         			<ol>
         				<li>
         					Designation of how many sides of the mass timber element will be exposed to fire 
         				</li>
         				<li>
         					Designation of which mass timber surfaces are encapsulated vs exposed  
         				</li>
         				<li>
         					If encapsulated, designation of where the encapsulation is located
         				</li>
         			</ol>
         		</li>
         	</ul>
         	<p>
         		If the entered compartment configuration is not code-compliant, the tool will generate warnings to alert the user. This feature enables the user to identify whether a compartment design complies with the 2025 NBC.
         	</p>
         	<p>
         		The tool will output a 3-D image of the compartment that the user can view, along with corresponding notes providing the encapsulation requirements and warnings. 
         	</p>
         	<p>
         		A list of definitions of important building code terms is also provided for reference.
         	</p>
         	<p>
         		While the Exposed Mass Timber Calculator facilitates an effective evaluation of permissible exposed mass timber elements in EMTC buildings, it is important to note that numerous other fire safety requirements must be considered in the building design. It is essential to refer to the relevant code articles to ensure compliance with these additional provisions.
         	</p>
         	<p>
         		The Exposed Mass Timber Calculator has been developed for information purposes only. Reference should always be made to the Building Code having jurisdiction. This tool should not be relied upon as a substitute for legal or design advice, and the user is responsible for how the tool is used or applied.
